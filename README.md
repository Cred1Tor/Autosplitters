# Prince of Persia: Warrior Within autosplitter  (Pog edition)
Livesplit autosplitter script for Prince of Persia: Warrior Within.
## Features
- Auto starting
- Auto splitting
- Auto resetting when you start a new game (your gold times will be updated without a confirmation window)
- Custom settings that allow you to choose any combination of splits you want
- Supports all categories
 
## How to use

In the settings window check the splits you want for the category you're going to run. You don't have to uncheck the parent settings of other categories, they only serve a cataloging purpose, the category is detected automatically. But it has to be exactly one of the following:
- Any% (Normal)
- Any% (Zipless)
- Any% (No Major Glitches)
- True Ending (Normal)
- True Ending (Zipless)
- True Ending (No Major Glitches)

You can ensure your category/subcategory name is correct if you choose them from the dropdown menus in the split settings:

Your split names don't have to match the ones from the settings, but they must be the same amount and go in the same order as in the settings.  
Take note that the script only checks the current split, if you somehow skipped one then you have to skip a split manually in livesplit.

If you encounter a bug or want to have a custom split added, you can contact me in discord: Creditor#0428
